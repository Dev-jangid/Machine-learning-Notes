    "1. **Region Proposal Generation**:\n",
    "   - RCNN starts by generating **region proposals** using an algorithm like **Selective Search**. These proposals are candidate bounding boxes where objects are likely located.\n",
    "   - Typically, around 2000 region proposals are generated for each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**:\n",
    "   - Each region proposal is resized to a fixed size (e.g., 224x224 pixels) and passed through a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** (e.g., AlexNet, VGG) to extract feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classification**:\n",
    "   - The feature vectors are fed into a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify the object inside the proposal into one of the predefined classes or mark it as background.\n",

    "   - A separate linear regression model is trained to refine the coordinates of the bounding boxes, improving localization accuracy.\n",

    "- For an input image, RCNN identifies multiple potential regions of interest, extracts features from these regions, and classifies them into object categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Region of Interest (ROI) Pooling**:\n",
    "   - Region proposals are mapped onto the shared feature map. Using **ROI Pooling**, fixed-size feature vectors are extracted for each region, eliminating the need to resize regions.\n",

    "- **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**: Generates region proposals.\n",
    "- **ROI Pooling/Align**: Extracts fixed-size features.\n",
    "- **Classification and Regression Heads**: Identify objects and refine bounding boxes.\n",
