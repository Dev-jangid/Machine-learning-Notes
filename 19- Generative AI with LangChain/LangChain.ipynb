    "#### **```what is the top_k and top_p ?? ```**\n",
    "**Top-k** and **top-p** are techniques used in language generation models to control how the next token (word or part of a word) is chosen during text generation. Both techniques aim to improve the quality and diversity of generated text while avoiding repetitive or nonsensical outputs. Here's what they mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Top-k Sampling**\n",
    "- In top-k sampling, the model selects the next token from the top \\(k\\) tokens with the highest probability. The rest of the tokens are ignored, which reduces the chance of picking low-probability tokens that might lead to incoherent text.\n",
    "- For example, if \\(k = 5\\), the model will only consider the top 5 tokens with the highest probabilities and sample from them.\n",
    "- This approach provides tighter control over randomness, ensuring the generated output aligns with the most likely options.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)**\n",
    "- In top-p sampling, instead of fixing the number of tokens (\\(k\\)), the model selects tokens based on cumulative probability. The model sums up the probabilities of the top tokens until they exceed a threshold \\(p\\) (e.g., \\(p = 0.9\\)).\n",
    "- This method allows the number of considered tokens to vary dynamically based on their probabilities. It ensures diversity in generation while still focusing on high-probability tokens.\n",
    "- For example, if \\(p = 0.9\\), the model chooses a subset of tokens whose combined probability is at least 0.9, then samples from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Differences:\n",
    "- **Top-k:** Limits by a fixed number (\\(k\\)) of tokens to sample from.\n",
    "- **Top-p:** Limits by a probability threshold (\\(p\\)), making the subset of tokens dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both techniques can be adjusted to balance randomness and coherence in generated text. Would you like to explore their implementation or how they influence model behavior? Let me know!"
