    "**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are a class of deep neural networks specifically designed for image processing tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation.

    "**Candidate**: **Image classification** involves assigning a single label to the entire image, such as ‚Äúcat‚Äù or ‚Äúdog.‚Äù In **object detection**, the model not only identifies the object‚Äôs class but also localizes it by drawing bounding boxes around it, specifying both the class and the position of the object in the image.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q1: What is tokenization in NLP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "**Tokenization** is the process of splitting text into smaller units, called **tokens**, such as words, characters, or subwords. This is often one of the first steps in text preprocessing. Tokenization helps the model understand the structure of the text and is essential for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.\n",

    "**Answer**:\n",
    "**Word embedding** refers to representing words in a continuous vector space, where similar words are close together. This is done through algorithms like **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **FastText**. Embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, helping models understand the meaning and context of words based on their usage in a corpus.\n",

    "**Answer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: It represents text as a set of individual words without considering their order. Each word is assigned a unique index, and a vector is created where each dimension corresponds to the frequency of the word in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: This is an improvement over BoW. It weighs the words by their frequency in the document (TF) and the inverse of their frequency across all documents (IDF), emphasizing more important words in the document and down-weighting common words like ‚Äúthe‚Äù or ‚Äúand.‚Äù\n",

    "**Named Entity Recognition (NER)** is an NLP task that identifies and classifies named entities (such as names of people, organizations, locations, etc.) in text. NER is often used in information extraction systems to pull out key entities from text.\n",
    "\n",

    "* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: These are neural networks designed to handle sequential data, like text or time series, by maintaining a memory of previous inputs. RNNs process the input step by step and maintain a hidden state that‚Äôs updated over time. However, they struggle with long-term dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transformers**: Transformers use **self-attention** mechanisms that allow them to weigh the importance of all parts of the input sequence simultaneously, without the need for sequential processing. This makes them faster and more effective at capturing long-range dependencies. Transformers are the foundation of models like **BERT** and **GPT**.\n",
